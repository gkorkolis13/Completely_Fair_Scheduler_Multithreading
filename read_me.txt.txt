Hello

Run the line 
	gcc assign_3_CFS_main.c -o scheduler line in the terminal

Then execute this line to save the output
	./scheduler >output.txt 

I had a few issues running it on Linux Ubuntu Virtual Machine, 
although I did the assignment on Windows Visual Studio Code. 

In case it doesn't properly run on Linux, try it on windows VS code
or run the exe file named assign_3_CFS_main.

Please see the c script file for comments and methodology on how the 
code works.

Check out to see the file name output_text_example.txt to see an example of
my execution on windows Visual Studio Code.

Thank you,
Georgios
